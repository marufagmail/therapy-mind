                    Our philosophy
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Highs and lows are a part of life, and life must go on. To keep our lives going on, we need certain conflicts and issues unaddressed.
                     These issues remain under the surface until they all pile up and become a mountain that then starts trying to rupture our emotional skin and break out.
                     At such moments, people usually get puzzled and can't make sense of what is happening to them as they lose track of their past issues.
                      It does not represent any emotional weakness or mental instability. It is natural and happens to everybody.
                      Sometimes, talking with your close friends and family members helps suppress the issues and give you a break until they break out again. 
                    
                    And sometimes, it is just not enough.That is when you need professional help like the one we offer. 
                    It would help if you had an environment where you can talk to somebody who listens, understands and can propose
                     solutions in a non-judgmental and private manner.</p>
